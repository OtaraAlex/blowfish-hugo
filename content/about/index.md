Hello ðŸ‘‹ I am a freelance Software Engineer and an Economics & Statistics student, based in Nairobi, Kenya.

## What I do

I've been actively shipping code for over three years. I primarily focus on front-end development, but ocassionally dabble in some full-stack development.

## Outside of Tech

Beyond tech, Iâ€™m into overlanding and love following travelersâ€™ journeys. Photography is another passion, and I'm always trying to capture the beauty I see through my lens.

These interests let me explore the world in different ways, both online and behind the camera.

## This Site 

Over the years, my blog has undergone a couple of changes. Initially, I made it with good ol' HTML, tried WordPress and Medium. Later, I started to use a couple of templates and making customizations to align with my personal style.

Currently, this site is built using [Hugo][hugo] static site generator and [Blowfish][blowfish].
