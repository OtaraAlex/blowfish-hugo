Hello ðŸ‘‹ I am a freelance Software Engineer and an Economics & Statistics student, based in Kenya.

## What I do

I've been actively shipping code for the past four years, specializing in Frontend and mobile development. Currently, I develop cross-platform mobile apps using React Native **(*Expo*)** and deliver full-stack web applications with React, Next.js, TypeScript, Tailwind, Prisma, Neon Serverless, MongoDB, and Appwrite.

I enjoy turning complex problems into clean, scalable code and collaborating between design and engineering to deliver actual value. Whether it's a responsive web dashboard or a mobile-first product, I care about performance, usability, and lean architecture.

## Outside of Tech

I'm drawn to overlanding and enjoy following the journeys of adventurous travellers. I'm also passionate about photography, always seeking to capture the world's splendor through my lens. These interests provide a rich tapestry of experiences and perspectives, allowing me to explore the globe both digitally and artistically.

Besides, I love learning foreign languages. Itâ€™s another way I connect with diverse cultures and broaden my worldview. Just as photography captures moments, language captures meaning, and both deepen my appreciation of the human experience.
